🍅Tomato Leaf Disease Prediction System: 
A machine learning-powered web application designed to predict tomato leaf diseases from uploaded images. This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify tomato leaf images into disease categories or as healthy. Integrated with a Flask backend, the system allows users to upload images via an HTML/CSS frontend and receive real-time predictions. Git is used for version control and collaboration.  

🔍 Key Features: 
- Trained CNN model for accurate disease classification.  
- Flask-based API for image uploads and predictions.  
- Simple, user-friendly web interface.  
- End-to-end ML pipeline from data processing to deployment.  

🚀 Tech Stack:
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras (model training)  
- Flask (backend/deployment)  
- HTML/CSS (frontend)  
- Git (version control)  

🎯 Learning Outcomes: 
- Develop skills in image-based disease prediction using deep learning.  
- Gain experience deploying ML models in a Flask web app.  
- Master version control and collaboration with Git.
