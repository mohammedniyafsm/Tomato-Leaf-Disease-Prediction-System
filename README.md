🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Prediction System
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts tomato leaf diseases from uploaded leaf images. Leveraging deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras, the system classifies tomato leaf images into various disease categories or marks them as healthy.

🔍 Key Features:

Trained CNN model for tomato leaf disease classification.

Flask-based web application for image uploads and real-time predictions.

User-friendly frontend with HTML/CSS.

Git-based version control for tracking code changes.

🚀 Tech Stack:

Python, TensorFlow/Keras for model building and training.

Flask for backend API and deployment.

HTML/CSS for the frontend interface.

Git for source control and collaboration.

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

Hands-on experience with image classification using deep learning.

Deploying ML models in real-world web apps.

Understanding of end-to-end ML pipelines from data to deployment.
